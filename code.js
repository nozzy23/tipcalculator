/* 
psuedo code
customer will add the total bill in the text input(I have to make sure that customer can only add numbers)
customer will then chose the service of the server. 
customer will then type how many guest they will want to split the check with(just like the total bill I need to limit my customer to only type number)

when customer hits submit we need to display 
the new bill with the tip included
and if the customer added other people to split check how much it will be for all of them.

I need to keep track of the total bill my customer added 

I need to keep track of what service my customer picked 

I need to keep track if my customer added any person to split the bill

I need to keep track of when the customer hit submit
